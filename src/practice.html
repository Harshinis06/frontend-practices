<h3><a id="career"></a>career</h3>

In the early 1980s, Depp's then-wife Lori Ann Allison introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage,
who advised him to pursue an acting career.[13] Depp's first film role was in the horror film A
Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), in which he played the boyfriend of heroine Nancy Thompson 
(Heather Langenkamp) and one of Freddy Krueger's victims.[13] After a starring role in the comedy 
Private Resort (1985), Depp was cast in the lead role of the skating drama Thrashin' (1986) by the 
film's director, but the decision was later overridden by its producer.[37][38] Instead, Depp 
appeared in a minor supporting role as a Vietnamese-speaking private in Oliver Stone's Vietnam 
Wardrama Platoon (1986). Depp became a teen idol during the late 1980s, when he starred as an 
undercover police officer in a high school operation in the Fox television series 21 Jump Street,
which premiered in 1987.[13] He accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who inspired
him. Despite his success, Depp felt that the series "forced [him] into the role of product.
"[39] He subsequently decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him.[39]</p>
