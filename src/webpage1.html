                        <tr><td font color="black" align="center"><b>HISTORY</b>A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction 
                                with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller,
                                keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback
                                for a player. This feedback is shown on a video display device, 
                                such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset.
                                Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through
                                speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback,
                                including haptic technology.Video games are defined based on their platform,
                                which include arcade games, console games, and personal computer (PC)
                                games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming 
                                through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented 
                                reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified 
                               into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.
                               The first video games were simple extensions of electronic games using 
                               video-like output from large room-size computers in the 1950s and 1960
                               while the first video games available to consumers appeared in 1971
                               through the release of the arcade game Computer Space, followed the
                               next year by Pong, and with the first home console the Magnavox Odyssey
                               in 1972. The quickly-</td>

                                Online gaming (disambiguation)
                                Early arcade games, home consoles, and handheld games were dedicated 
                                hardware units with the game's logic built into the electronic
                                componentry of the hardware. Since then, most video game platforms
                                have means to use multiple games distributed on different types of 
                                media or formats. Physical formats include ROM cartridges, magnetic 
                                storage including magnetic tape data storage and floppy discs, optical
                                media formats including CD-ROM and DVDs, and flash memory cards. 
                                Furthermore digital distribution over the Internet or other
                                communication methods as well as cloud gaming alleviate the need
                                for any physical media. In some cases, the media serves as the direct
                                read-only memory for the game, or it may be the form of installation
                                media that is used to write the main assets to the player's platform's
                                local storage for faster loading periods and later updates.
                                Games can be extended with new content and software patches through
                                either expansion packs which are typically available as physical media
                                or as downloadable content nominally available via digital distribution.
                               These can be offered freely or can be used to monetize a game following
                               its initial release. Several games offer players the ability to create
                               user-generated content to share with others to play. Other games,
                               mostly those on personal computers, can be extended with user-created 
                               modifications or mods that alter or add onto the game;

                                video game cultureA video game, like most other forms of media,
                                may be categorized into genres. However, unlike film or television 
                                which use visual or narrative elements, video games are generally 
                                categorized into genres based on their gameplay interaction, since
                               this is the primary means which one interacts with a video game.
                                The narrative setting does not impact gameplay; a shooter game is 
                               still a shooter game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy
                               world or in outer space.[33][34] An exception is the horror game genre,
                               used for games that are based on narrative elements of horror fiction,
                              the supernatural, and psychological horror.
                               growing industry suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and oversaturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.
