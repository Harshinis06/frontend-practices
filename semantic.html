                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed
                    to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is
                    often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
                    such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
                    and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
                    page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

                    of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
                    SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
                    and JavaScript.[2]Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
                    presentation

                <h3>JAVA</h3>
                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to
                    have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming
                    language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that
                    compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile
                    .[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual
                    machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.</p>

                    helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP,
                    or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems,[1] JSP is similar to PHP and
                    ASP, but uses the Java programming language.
